This Named Entity Recognition (NER) model is one of my initial projects in Natural Language Processing (NLP), built primarily with TensorFlow. Leveraging TensorFlow's straightforward syntax and rich set of functions, this project was both a learning experience and a practical tool for identifying named entities within text.

### Examples of Real-world Applications:
1. **Information Extraction**: Extracting names of people, organizations, and locations from news articles, enabling quick summarization and analysis.
2. **Resume Parsing**: Identifying key information such as skills, experiences, and contact details from resumes, aiding in automated recruitment processes.
3. **Medical Record Analysis**: Recognizing entities like diseases, treatments, and patient names from medical records, facilitating medical research and patient care.
And a lot more.
